    "title": "Frequently Asked",
    "titleHighlight": "Questions",
    "subtitle": "Get answers about our solutions",
    "q1": "How long does it take to assemble a modular stand?",
    "a1": "Assembly is extremely fast thanks to the click-in system. A standard 9m² stand can be assembled in less than 1 hour by 2 people, without the need for special tools.",
    "q2": "How many times can I reuse the structures?",
    "a2": "Smart Signage structures are designed for extreme durability. They can be reused at 10+ events without loss of visual or structural quality, maintaining professional photographic finish.",
    "q3": "How does transportation and storage work?",
    "a3": "Modules are compacted in special transport cases, reducing volume by up to 70%. This facilitates transportation, reduces shipping costs and allows storage in small spaces.",
    "q4": "Can I adapt the design between events?",
    "a4": "Yes! The modularity allows you to completely reconfigure the layout. You can create different formations, add or remove modules, and change graphics for each specific event.",
    "q5": "Can Smart Signage withstand outdoor events?",
    "a5": "The structures are developed in high-resistance aluminum and tensioned fabric with UV treatment. They are suitable for indoor and covered outdoor environments, but we recommend protection against direct rain.",
    "q6": "What is the print quality compared to canvas or vinyl?",
    "a6": "We use sublimation printing on special fabric that offers more vibrant colors, better resolution and premium finish. The result is superior to canvas or vinyl, with professional photographic appearance.",
    "q7": "Do I need a specialized team to assemble?",
    "a7": "No! The system is intuitive and can be assembled by anyone after quick training. We provide visual manuals and video support. We also offer optional assembly service.",
    "q8": "Is Smart Signage more expensive than wooden stands?",
    "a8": "The initial investment may be 30% higher, but positive ROI happens as early as the 2nd event. Over 3 years and 12 events, savings reach 70% compared to traditional disposable stands.",
    "q9": "Do you do custom projects?",
    "a9": "Yes! Our design team develops customized solutions combining different modules. We also create special modules for specific needs, maintaining system compatibility.",
    "q10": "How does the warranty work?",
    "a10": "We offer 12 months warranty for manufacturing defects on the aluminum structure and 6 months for tensioned graphics. We also provide lifetime technical support and parts replacement."
